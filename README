ers -- Easily replace strings in templates

Description
-----------

Given a file with %tags%, replace each tag with the value passed
in the command line.

Example
-------

If you have the following template:

	$ cat example.txt
	%foo% %bar%

You can replace the tags with this command:

	$ ers example.txt foo=1 bar=2

The result will be printed to standard output.

If you want to replace strings in standard input instead, just pass
`-` as the file argument:

	$ cat example.txt | ers - foo=1 bar=2

The result will be the same as in the previous example.

Installation
------------

Make sure you have `awk` in your system, then copy `ers` anywhere
in your path.
